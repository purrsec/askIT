# üöÄ Project: AskIT-CLI

**AskIT-CLI** is an intelligent command-line assistant, designed to be fast, efficient, and context-aware. It simplifies administrative tasks by allowing you to use natural language to generate and execute shell commands, all while staying in your terminal.

---

## üî• Simplified Workflow

### First Use

The `askit-cli init` command is the starting point. It initializes your project by creating an `.askit` directory. Then, it launches an intelligent process to build the context:
*   **Automatic Scan:** It searches for key files like Ansible inventories, Terraform files, etc.
*   **Interactive Questionnaire:** To complete the information, `init` asks you a few questions about the project's objectives, technical stack, and conventions.

Everything is stored in configuration and cache files within the `.askit` directory.

If you run `askit-cli` without an `.askit` directory being found in the current folder or its parents, the tool will suggest running `init` to get started.

### Daily Use

1.  **Make your request**: From any folder in your project, formulate a request in a single line.

    ```bash
    askit-cli -c 10 -p modify the terraform file to add a private VPC with a public subnet
    ```
    *   `-c 10`: Provides the last 10 commands from your shell history as context.
    *   `-p`: Everything that follows is your instruction (prompt), without needing quotes.

2.  **Receive the answer**: AskIT-CLI analyzes your request with the context and offers a solution.

    *   **Case 1: 100% confidence (and `strike` mode)**
        The tool is certain of the command to execute. It displays it directly in your terminal, ready to be validated.
        ```bash
        > sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
        [Press Enter to execute, or Ctrl+C to cancel]
        ```
        You just have to press **Enter** to run it.

    *   **Case 2: Doubt or `normal` mode**
        The tool is not certain, or you are in `normal` mode. It displays a suggestion that you can freely copy, modify, or ignore.
        ```bash
        > Suggestion: check existing rules before adding a new one.
        ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Commands & Arguments

| Action                | Description                                                          | Type      | Example                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `init`                | Initializes or updates the project: creates the `.askit` directory and (re)generates the context cache. | Command   | `askit-cli init`                               |
| `config`              | Opens the interactive configuration menu (Cisco style).              | Command   | `askit-cli config`                             |
| `-p <prompt>`         | **(Required)** The user prompt. Must be the last argument. | Argument  | `askit-cli -p "add a public subnet"`                  |
| `-c <number>`         | Number of shell history lines to send as context.        | Argument  | `-c 10`                                        |
| `--safe`              | Activates "Safe Mode" (rejects commands deemed risky).        | Argument  | `askit-cli --safe -p "delete the cache"`     |

---

## üß† Context & Cache

`askit-cli` finds the project root by looking for an `.askit` directory. This folder contains all the context.

The `init` command is the heart of the context system. Instead of asking you to maintain a manual file, `init` automates information gathering:

1.  **Ansible Compatibility:** It parses Ansible inventory files (`inventory`, `hosts.yml`, etc.) to understand your infrastructure, host groups, and variables.
2.  **Terraform Analysis:** It reads your `.tf` and `.tfvars` files to learn about your providers, resources, and modules.
3.  **Configuration Questionnaire:** If information is missing, `init` launches an interactive setup to define non-detectable elements:
    - The main objective of the project.
    - Specific security rules (e.g., `"Never run terraform destroy"`).
    - Frequently used custom aliases or scripts.

The collected information is stored in `.askit/config.yaml` (questionnaire answers, configuration) and `.askit/context.json` (content of scanned files). You can re-run `init` at any time to update the context.

This approach allows for **cross-directory** reading: you can be in a `terraform/` subdirectory and `askit-cli` will be aware of the `ansible/inventory` file located elsewhere in the project.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration (Cisco CLI Style)

For fine-tuned configuration familiar to network/system administrators, use the `config` command.

```bash
askit-cli config
```

This opens an interactive menu where you can use simple and clear commands:

| Command                  | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `set mode <strike\|normal>` | Sets the global operating mode.                                |
| `set api_key`            | Opens a secure prompt for your API key. It will **never** be stored in plaintext in `config.yaml`. |
| `show config`            | Displays the current configuration (the API key is masked).              |
| `exit`                   | Exits the configuration menu.                                         |

The tool will always look for an API key via an environment variable first (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`). The `set api_key` command is an alternative that securely stores the key in the OS keychain (credential manager).

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Modes

Execution logic is controlled by a single parameter: the `mode`.

*   **`normal` mode (default)**: The tool offers suggestions but never pre-fills your command line. This is the safest mode.
*   **`strike` mode**: If the AI's confidence is 100%, the command is directly inserted into your terminal, ready for execution with the **Enter** key. This is the fastest mode.
*   **`--safe` flag**: Can be added to any command to override the behavior and prevent the execution of any command deemed risky (e.g., `rm -rf`, `terraform destroy`), even in `strike` mode.

---

## üìù Golden Rules

1.  The `-p` argument must **always** be the last one.
2.  Everything following `-p` is considered the raw prompt. No quotes are needed.
3.  If you use `-c`, it must be placed before `-p`.
4.  Direct execution of a command is only possible in **`strike` mode** with a **100% confidence level**. In all other cases, confirmation or manual action is required.

## üß† Features

### General Operation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic scan of the current project
2Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic construction of the full context
3Ô∏è‚É£ Generation of the enriched prompt
4Ô∏è‚É£ Call to the Claude API (or selected AI backend)
5Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation of the result in 2 forms:
    * **100% safe single command** ‚ûî execution possible
    * **Partial suggestion** ‚ûî requests user confirmation
6Ô∏è‚É£ Local logging for audit

### Project Context Detection

On startup, AskIT-CLI scans the current directory for files like:
* `ansible.cfg`, `inventory`, `*.yml`
* `terraform.tf`, `*.tf`, `*.tfvars`
* `README.md`
* `*.env`, `config.yaml`, `*.ini`

### Interactive `init`

On the first run or on demand, the `init` command asks the administrator a series of questions to configure the project context. The answers are stored in `.askit/config.yaml` and serve as a permanent guide for the AI.

### Shell History Management

Native history retrieval on Bash, Zsh, PowerShell.

### Secure Execution

The user validates or edits the command proposed by the AI before execution (unless the `--confirm` option is used).

### *AutoPilot* Mode

Iterative mode for automatic problem correction, where each command is tested and validated.

---

## üîê Security & Anonymization

* **Adaptive Secret Masking**: Secrets (`api_key`, `token`, `password`, `AWS_*`, etc.) are partially masked before being sent to the AI to avoid leaking sensitive information.
* **No leakage of full values** in prompts.
* **Local audit** of proposed commands.
* **Logging** possible for SecOps audit.
* **PII Detection**: Neutralization of any sensitive personal data.

## üóÇ Project File Structure (after `init`)

```
