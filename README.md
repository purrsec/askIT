3. Or disable Windows Defender SmartScreen temporarily

**Alternative**: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and follow Linux instructions.

### macOS Security Issues

If you see "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified":

```bash
# Method 1: Allow the specific app
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/lib/askit-cli/
sudo spctl --add /usr/local/lib/askit-cli/askit-cli

# Method 2: Temporarily disable Gatekeeper (not recommended)
sudo spctl --master-disable
# Re-enable after installation
sudo spctl --master-enable
```

### Linux Permission Issues

If you get permission errors:
```bash
# Fix permissions
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/askit-cli
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/lib/askit-cli/askit-cli

# Or install to user directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp askit-cli ~/.local/bin/
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
